# Disk Operating System

DOS, or Disk Operating System, holds a significant place in computing history as one of the pioneering operating systems. Initially developed by Microsoft, it became ubiquitous in the 1980s and early 1990s, serving as the primary interface for personal computers. Characterized by its command-line interface, users interacted with DOS through typed commands, navigating file systems and executing programs. Despite its simplicity, DOS provided a robust platform for software development and application execution, laying the groundwork for the digital revolution. Its influence persists in modern computing, as DOS principles underpin many aspects of contemporary operating systems.
